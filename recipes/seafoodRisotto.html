    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large leek, cleaned and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>½ pound bay scallops</li>
        <li>½ pound medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh snow peas, trimmed and halved crosswise</li>
        <li>1 medium red bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Add leek and garlic; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add rice and cook for 5 minutes more, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Pour in 1 1/2 cups chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes, continuing to stir occasionally. Pour in remaining chicken broth and wine; increase heat to medium and cook for about 5 more minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Add scallops, shrimp, peas, and red pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until remaining liquid is almost absorbed and seafood has cooked, about 5 minutes. When rice is just tender and slightly creamy, season with Parmesan cheese, basil, lemon juice, and pepper.</li>
